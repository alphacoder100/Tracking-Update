    # Minimum face cosine similarity to recognise a detection as a RETURNING
    # visitor. buffalo_l ArcFace same-person similarity is typically 0.5-0.7 and
    # different-person 0.1-0.3; 0.55 is a sensible starting point but MUST be
    # re-calibrated on your own camera footage.
    RETURNING_FACE_THRESHOLD: float = 0.55
    # Below this, a detection is treated as definitely a NEW visitor (no body
    # check). Between this and RETURNING_FACE_THRESHOLD is the "grey zone".
    REJECT_SIMILARITY: float = 0.35

    STRONG_MATCH_THRESHOLD: float = 0.65
    # A new visitor is only auto-created when the best gallery similarity is at
